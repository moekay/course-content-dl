    "One application of large CNNs is **facial recognition**. The problem formulation in facial recognition is a little different from the image classification we've seen so far. In facial recognition, we don't want to have a fixed number of individuals that the model can learn. If that were the case then to learn a new person it would be necessary to modify the output portion of the architecture and retrain to account for the new person.\n",

When the model is trained, it takes as input an image and outputs an embedding vector corresponding to the image. \n",

The loss requires the distance between the anchor and negative points to be greater than a margin $\\alpha$ + the distance between the anchor and positive points."
