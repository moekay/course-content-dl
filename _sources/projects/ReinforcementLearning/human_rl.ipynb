    "# Using RL to Model Cognitive Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "## TODO\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚠️ This is a work in progress.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement more intelligent agents (using Acme).\n",
    "- find appropriate behavioral datasets.\n",
    "- add more documentations.\n",
    "- utility functions to plot the agent performance and the env.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cognitive scientists use standard lab tests to tap into specific processes in the brain and behavior. Some examples of those tests are Stroop, N-back, Digit Span, TMT (Trail making tests), and WCST (Wisconsin Card Sorting Tests).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Despite an extensive body of research that explains human performance using descriptive what-models, we still need a more sophisticated approach to gain a better understanding of the underlying processes (i.e., a how-model).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interestingly, many of such tests can be thought of as a continuous stream of stimuli and corresponding actions, that is in consonant with the RL formulation. In fact, RL itself is in part motivated by how the brain enables goal-directed behaviors using reward systems, making it a good choice to explain human performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This project aims to use behavioral data to train an agent and then use the agent to investigate data produced by human subjects. Having a computational agent that mimics humans in such tests, we will be able to compare its mechanics with human data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In another conception, we could fit an agent that learns many cognitive tasks that require abstract-level constructs such as executive functions. This is a multi-task control problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "- One example would be the N-back task.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - In the N-back, participants view a sequence of stimuli, one by one, and are asked to categorize each stimulus as being either match or non-match. Stimuli are usually numbers, and feedback is given at both timestep and trajectory levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The agent is rewarded when its response matches the stimulus that was shown N steps back in the episode. A simpler version of the N-back uses two-choice action schema, that is match vs non-match. Once the present stimulus matches the one presented N step back, then the agent is expected to respond to it as being a `match`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Given a trained RL agent, we then find correlates of its fitted parameters with the brain mechanisms. The most straightforward composition could be the correlation of model parameters with the brain activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "- HCP WM task ([NMA-CN HCP notebooks](https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/course-content/tree/master/projects/fMRI))\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Any dataset that used cognitive tests would work.\n",
    "Question: limit to behavioral data vs fMRI?\n",
    "Question: Which stimuli and actions to use?\n",
    "classic tests can be modeled using 1) bounded symbolic stimuli/actions (e.g., A, B, C), but more sophisticated one would require texts or images (e.g., face vs neutral images in social stroop dataset)\n",
    "The HCP dataset from NMA-CN contains behavioral and imaging data for 7 cognitive tests including various versions of N-back.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### N-back\n",
    "\n",
    "In the N-back task, participants view a sequence of stimuli, one per time, and are asked to categorize each stimulus as being either match or non-match. Stimuli are usually numbers, and feedbacks are given at both timestep and trajectory levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a typical neuro setup, both accuracy and response time are measured, but here, for the sake of brevity, we focus only on accuracy of responses.\n",
    "\n"
